G'day, This repository has become the primary repository for version two of the Remodel framework. Unfortunately I am *bad* at remembering passwords :-)
Please feel free to play with the modelling framework -- I am currently in the process of converting the scheme code in Remodel to python.  Anyone who has an interest in
participating in further development or helping with the translation will be welcome with open arms!

Cheers!
